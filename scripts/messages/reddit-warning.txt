Reminder that you must use slack once every two weeks to remain a member of the rLoop Project.
Hi!

Just a friendy robot letting you know that it is a requirement to use [Slack](http://rloop.slack.com/) at least once every two weeks to maintain membership of the rLoop project. If you're on vacation, please just reply to this message or login to slack and let your leader know.

Thanks!

P.S. If for some reason you'd like to leave, just ignore this email, and you'll automatically be removed in a week.
